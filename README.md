# JerryD-s-Website

Welcome to the official website of **Jerry D's Saloon**, a cozy and lively neighborhood restaurant located in Parkville, Maryland. I created this website to showcase the restaurant's menu, location, and contact information. The site is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, ensuring a seamless experience for visitors on both desktop and mobile devices.

This repository contains the source code for our responsive, single-page (or multi-page) static website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and hosted with GitHub Pages.
